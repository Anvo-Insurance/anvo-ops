# Anvo Insurance — Operational Knowledge Base (`anvo-brain`)

## What This Repo Is

This is Anvo Insurance's shared operational knowledge base. It contains structured, machine-readable instructions that govern how Anvo operates — from carrier appetite and submission workflows to intake processing, commissions reporting, cold outreach, and strategic business analysis.

Every file in this repo is written for **Claude Cowork agents as the primary reader**, with human team members as secondary readers. Instructions are explicit, unambiguous, and actionable. There is no prose for prose's sake.

## Who Uses This Repo

| User | Role | How They Use It |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Edward Hsyeh | Managing Partner | Authors and maintains operational instructions. Final authority on all content. |
| Alice | Operations | References for day-to-day processing. Contributes updates from carrier interactions. |
| Claude Cowork Agents | Automated processing | Reads files as operational instructions to execute tasks (intake, submissions, follow-ups, commissions, outreach). |

## First-Time Setup

**If you are Alice (or any non-technical user setting up on macOS):** open `ALICE_INSTALL.md`. It's a step-by-step guide that walks you through installing GitHub Desktop, cloning the repo, installing Claude Desktop, and kicking off the rest of setup — with Claude Cowork doing the technical parts for you.

**If you are setting up on Windows (Edward, or any future Windows user):** follow `SETUP_WINDOWS.md` — a manual walkthrough using PowerShell.

**If you are a Cowork agent being asked to set up the repo on someone's Mac:** read `SETUP_MAC.md`. That file is a runbook written for you (Claude) to execute, with explicit narration scripts for talking to the human user.

All three files cover the same end state: cloned repo, `~/.anvo-secrets/` folder populated with the OAuth credentials, `ANVO_SECRETS_DIR` env var set, and a verified Sheets/Drive/Gmail read.

## How to Use This Repo

### For Humans
1. **Before every Cowork session:** `git pull` to ensure agents read the latest instructions.
2. **After editing any file:** `git push` so changes propagate to all sessions.
3. **When writing or editing:** Write as if you are giving instructions to a new employee who is extremely literal. State what to do, when to do it, and what exceptions exist.

### For Claude Agents
1. **Read before acting.** When a task references a business function (e.g., "submit this risk"), locate and read the relevant instruction file before executing.
2. **Follow decision criteria exactly.** If a file says "escalate to Edward if X," do that — do not improvise.
3. **Cross-reference.** Files reference each other. Follow those references to get full context.
4. **Flag gaps.** If an instruction file has `<!-- TODO -->` markers or missing information that blocks execution, stop and alert Edward.

## Folder Conventions

Top-level folders map to **business functions**. Subfolders map to **sub-concerns** within that function.

## File Authoring Rules

1. **Every file is an instruction set.** Not a wiki article. Not a reference doc. An instruction set.
2. **Use `<!-- TODO: Edward to fill in -->` markers** for content that needs human input.
3. **Cross-reference with relative paths** (e.g., "See `carriers/carrier_matrix.md`").
4. **Formatting:** H1 = file title, H2 = major sections, H3 = subsections. No deeper nesting.
5. **No fluff.** Every line is either an instruction, a decision criterion, or a data field.
6. **Date format:** YYYY-MM-DD everywhere.
7. **When in doubt, be more explicit.** Over-specification is better than ambiguity.

## Secrets & Credentials

**Never commit credential files into this repo.** All `.json` keys, OAuth tokens, and service account files live in `~/.anvo-secrets/` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.anvo-secrets\` (Windows), referenced by the `.mcp.json` via the `ANVO_SECRETS_DIR` environment variable. See `SETUP_MAC.md` / `SETUP_WINDOWS.md` for setup details.
